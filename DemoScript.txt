Module 1:
===========================================================
This module shows some of the new features. I picked these
features first because they are easy to explain for 
simple use cases, and they should be good 'hooks' for the
audience.

Step one: Create the project, add an EvilGenius Class.
The first version of the EvilGenius class just has the 
three properties.

2: Let's add an override of ToString() so the Evil
Genius can announce himself to the world. Do this using
the classic syntax. Include creating an EvilGenius in
Main() and writing a console message.

3. Translate ToString() to an expression bodied member.
Discuss benefits.

4. In Main, replace Console.WriteLine with WriteLine
and a static using. Point out that you don't get a 
codefix for a static using. (Is that coming? Community
contribution?)  Add the static using statement. Point
out that intellisense knows to filter namespaces vs.
classes depending on the presence of the 'static' keyword
in the using statement.

Let's take a few moments to talk about both of these features.
Expression Bodied Members:
. Must be single expressions (not multi-line anonymous functions)
. Could be LINQ queries, which might be complex
. great for read only properties (which we will cover later.)

Static Usings:
. De clutter source. (We know WriteLine is likely in theConsole
class)
. Consider Math class, even System.String.
. Later, we'll discuss how static usings work with Extension 
methods.

Now, let's move on to the null coalescing operator

5. Change the henchman to a class (we will add more properties
and features later.)
