Module 1:
===========================================================
This module shows some of the new features. I picked these
features first because they are easy to explain for 
simple use cases, and they should be good 'hooks' for the
audience.

Step one: Create the project, add an EvilGenius Class.
The first version of the EvilGenius class just has the 
three properties.

2: Let's add an override of ToString() so the Evil
Genius can announce himself to the world. Do this using
the classic syntax. Include creating an EvilGenius in
Main() and writing a console message.

3. Translate ToString() to an expression bodied member.
Discuss benefits.
